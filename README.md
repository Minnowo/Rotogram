# Rotogram
A text adventure game from grade 11 computer science.  

This codebase is really bad. I might clean it up later, but it's like 3 years old and was probably the first major thing I ever wrote.  

## The Game

Rotogram is a text based adventure game. It's nothing special, you get information in the form of text, and perform actions by typing them out.  
The game is pretty small in both story and content, there's a maximum of 3 or 4 weapons and a few planned encounters during the playthrough of the game.  
There are 2 endings, you can either defeat Gravity Worm, or Apple Worm both of which result in the same ending, but we all know which should be killed ;3c

## Meta

There is a very clear meta in this game, this is because there's a best weapon, and setup  
You are gonna want to greatly increase the odds of actually finishing the game, I don't actually think it's possible without a few key items:

- Shield 
- Shelly's Love
- Axe 
- Apple Cloak / Gravity Cloak

These items are vital to actually killing the final bosses, this is because the combat in the game is very RNG relient.
The `Shield` is a very strong item that has a 1/2 chance of completely blocking all damage. This makes surviving the final boss much easier.
`Shelly's Love` is a healing item which heals 1-5 HP every time the user inputs a command, this being the only passive healing item in the game makes it very strong.
The `Axe` is good because it has the highest damage of all the weapons, and the `Apple Cloack` and `Gravity Cloak` both give the play an extra 100 HP.
